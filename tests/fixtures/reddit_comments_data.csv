30,MC-Jdf,"We phoned it in defensively. Granted the Nuggets shot lights out, Jokic had an MVP game, Bones was Steph Curry incarnate for a good moment, Monte and AG had 45 combined but we were feeling just way too comfortable defensively. Put us on a 17-point hole and were down 10 with 6 minutes go which ultimately made the late rally come too late. 27 fouls leading to 36 free throws too was a problem. Our rebounding was much better however.

Offensively we did a lot of things well to put us in a good position although the turnovers and missed free throws (from our good free throw shooters too) bit us badly. Even Kuminga had a nice sprint run. Klay was amazing (as he has been this whole series), Wiggins continued to step up, Dray was picking apart the defense and Steph had a huge 2nd half. Poole came down to Earth but he was bound to so not too upset about that. With that said our bench scoring sans Steph (lol) has been dead in the water. I get we have 4 guys that can get 20 but 4 bench players had 0 field goals. That's not good.

Not too upset about the inbounds play towards the end because really Porter could've just thrown it over Rivers but instead underthrew it which was kinda dumb. Granted trusting Steph or Klay for one more possession would've been ideal but that was a decent play call.

But please let's not run that Steph/GP2/Iguodala/Porter/Beli lineup because that lineup really put the game out of our reach for a while.

We've now cracked the 120-point mark in 3 out of our 4 games and in the only time we didn't, we scored 118. This series isn't really a complete indicator of our offense given how well we match up offensively against the Nuggets and our 5 best players are all averaging 50% from the field and 60 TS%. Still, it is a great sign nonetheless. We'll see as we progress deeper into the playoffs just how better defenses try to guard us, but this Steph/Klay/Poole/Wiggins/Draymond experiment is working exceptionally well.

We gotta do a better job defensively though. Defensive rotations in general and defenses against stop-and-pop players (i.e. Monte Morris) desire clear-cut improvement. The Nuggets are a very good offensive team (6th best in the regular season) and Jokic is a walking mismatch but we're bound to face even better offensive teams that'll demand another level of defensive attention.

Series shifts back to our home floor at Chase Center, and from what our main guys have said after the game we seem determined to finish this series as soon as possible. Hopefully we can close out the series in Game 5.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ubjgtu/serious_next_day_thread_postgame_discussion_april/,Warriors1,:gsw-1: Warriors,1650894094.0,2022-04-25,2022-04-25 11:30:37.057985
31,must_throw_away_now,"What a game. Exciting down to the last minute.

A few things I noticed.

1. Denver shot the lights out from 3. I don't know if they can replicate that for another 3 games but the role players stepped up big time at home in an elimination game.
2. Something was clearly bothering Curry. 4 missed FTs, just looked uncomfortable the entire game shooting but was getting it done when he put the ball on the floor and took it to the rack, so not super concerned there, maybe just some lingering soreness/fatigue from ramping back up after being out for some time.
3. It seemed like Denver's goal was to lock Jordan Poole up and not let him get into any rhythm and they did it well. Aaron Gordon did a great job 1x1. It also felt like he was forcing things a bid with a few bad turnovers down the stretch where we could have slowed it down a bit but that's just his play style I think and you kind of have to take the good with the bad because when he's good it's amazing.
4. People are weirdly reactionary about Wiggins on like a play-by-play basis. He has an efficient 20 pt game shooting 9/16 and is just solid out there. He missed that dunk at the end but that was a tough one to get and he only even had a chance because of his stupid athleticism.  I don't know what else you can expect from the guy besides hoping he take a paycut on his next contract to save some luxury tax dollars. He's a steady presence out there.
5. Dray and Klay need to stay out of foul trouble. Refs aside, they were bad both ways last night but Dray fouling out killed the Warriors. Klay being out for a long stretch was tough too.
6. Not the best play call at the end by Kerr when you have Klay and Curry on the floor but it happens. Dray not being the passer on this play probably had a lot to do with it too as OPJ left it well short.

On to the next one at home.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ubjgtu/serious_next_day_thread_postgame_discussion_april/,Warriors5,:gsw-5: Warriors,False,2022-04-25,2022-04-25 11:30:37.057985
32,mansatrol,I think Dubs are going be fine. It took Denver to shoot 50/48 splits and some massive defensive breakdowns in the 3rd quarter from the Dubs to even compete. Not to mention all these 90% FT shooters missing uncharacteristically and JP having a bad night. Also no points from the bench except Kuminga (and Curry ofc).

Steph is one of the greatest off ball players of all time, and Klay is right there with Steph. Draymond doesn’t even score. Of our big 3 before KD, exactly none of them are ball dominant players. The reason “there only one ball” didn’t apply to the warriors is that there was only one ball dominant player in the KD era: KD. On the nets, both KD/Kyrie/Harden and KD/Kyrie/Simmons are ball dominate trios. All of them. The nets offense was a “you go, then I’ll go” type of thing, rather than “let’s all move around together on and off ball, and find the best shot as a team.” If you’re playing iso basketball, your second (much less your third) iso player is a huge diminishing return. Instead of “you go, then I’ll go” as the nets offense currently is, I think they’d be much better off giving the ball to KD every time and say “No, KD, you go every time. No one else.”, and trading Kyrie and Simmons for quality role players and 3 and D type guys.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ubkeiw/james_alexander_i_think_this_whole_nets/,Warriors2,Warriors,False,2022-04-25,2022-04-25 11:30:37.057985

Where does this sentiment come from? Sean Marks has been *amazing* in his tenure as the Nets GM. Hell, one reason Durant and Irving decided to go to the Nets was that Brooklyn looked like an elite organisation (which they are). 

But ever since Durant and Irving joined the Nets they had an enormous impact no the Nets' decision-making. That's why player empowerment is terrible for the league.

247,ThatDeleuzeGuy,"I think that we ought to think about the coaches the way we think about players. We often discuss players in terms like Floor Raiser/Ceiling Raiser etc. 

I think Doc Rivers is clearly a good 'floor raiser' coach. If you look at his teams he can usually get them to the playoffs even if they lack a true superstar. He can get players to buy-in and work together and he does a lot of the things that can help an undertalented team overachieve. But he isn't a ceiling raiser. I think he lacks the in-game X's and O's to truly make a team that isn't already overwhelmingly loaded with talent into a championship contender.

If you compare that with the coaches that are viewed as being the best currently (Spoelstra, Nurse, Kerr, Popovich etc) They've all demonstrated the ability to be both floor raisers and ceiling raisers as coaches. They've overachieved with meh squads, while also making great adjustments in game, and across a series in the playoffs to give their teams the best chance to succeed and win a title. 

I think it's probably not correct to say that Doc is a *bad* coach, but I wouldn't really look at him to be the coach for a teach with  a title window.

In truth, Chalmers was truly a huge part of these Finals. He had games in which he vanished, most notably in San Antonio. In wins, Chalmers averaged 15 points on 50-percent shooting, in the three losses, just five points on 20 percent.

Honestly the trade didn't go south, Harden was professional but Marks didn't have the ability to rein Kyrie and KD in. It's not like Harden stunk it up, Kyrie was the one fucking it up. Things going south has nothing to do with Harden, in fact he left because things were going south.

People also forgot that Marks didn't want to pay Allen and wanted to Deandre to start (KD and Kyrie fucking things up again). So he traded Allen. It's not like he gave up a treasured asset to land Harden. 

Also the trade was pretty low risk, because he can always trade Harden for a haul anyway. He's just dumb to choose Ben Simmons as the haul.
